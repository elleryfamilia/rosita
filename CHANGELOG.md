# Changelog

All notable changes to rosita are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions aim for
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

`dist` pulls the section matching a tagged version into that release's notes, so
keep entries user-facing. When cutting a release, rename **Unreleased** to the
version and date (see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md)).

## Unreleased

### Added

- `rosita studio` guided first-run: lands on the **Profiles** tab and walks a
  three-step onboarding — welcome (detect stack + pick a starter pack) → review
  what will change → "you're set" (names `rosita run <agent>`). A top-bar **?**
  button re-opens the tour anytime.
- Release pipeline via [`dist`](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/): tagging
  `vX.Y.Z` builds prebuilt binaries for macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel), Linux
  (x86_64 + ARM64), and Windows (x86_64), with shell + PowerShell installers
  attached to the GitHub Release.
- CI workflow: rustfmt, clippy (`-D warnings`), the test suite on Linux + macOS,
  and an MSRV (1.85) check.
