//!   `~/.config/loadout/config.toml`). Overridable via `LOADOUT_CONFIG_DIR`
//!   (used in tests and for isolation).
//! - Repo: `<repo_base>/.loadout/config.toml`, where `repo_base` is the git
//!   root (or the cwd when not in a repo).
//! - `local.toml` (in either dir) is the **private**, gitignored layer for
