//! Resolving dynamic capabilities — live provider/command output, trust-gated.
//!
//! A capability is *dynamic* when it has a `provider` (a built-in probe) or a
//! `command` (a shell command). At render time [`resolve`] produces its output,
//! honoring the cache and the trust model:
//!
//! - built-in `provider` → always allowed (safe probes),
//! - `command` from a built-in/global layer → allowed (you authored it),
//! - `command` from a repo layer → allowed only if the repo is trusted
//!   ([`crate::trust`]); otherwise it is refused and a skip note is rendered.
//!
//! [`DynamicMode::ReadOnly`] (used by `explain` and dry-run) never executes or
//! writes — it surfaces only what is already cached. This keeps `explain`
//! side-effect-free and honors "dry-run touches nothing".
