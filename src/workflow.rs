//! Workflows — a named, ordered stage spine bound to a profile.
//!
//! A **workflow** is loadout's house process spine: an ordered list of
//! **stages** (e.g. Research → Specify → Plan → Implement → Verify → Review)
//! that travels across every agent through the same per-agent render pipeline a
//! profile already uses. A profile binds exactly one workflow by id
//! ([`crate::profile::LoadoutConfig::workflow`]); selection stays deterministic.
//!
//! Each stage carries a short contract — a free-string `name`, a `purpose`,
//! optional `reads`/`writes` of a **handoff artifact**, an optional `gate`, and
//! an optional `exit` checklist. The handoff artifact is the load-bearing part:
//! a file under `.loadout/workflow/artifacts/` (e.g. Plan writes `plan.md`,
//! Implement reads it) that carries state from one stage to the next. It is what
//! makes a workflow more than "a profile with subheadings".
//!
//! loadout owns the path convention and renders the spine, but it never
//! enforces, judges completion, or tracks a live "current stage" — this is
//! guidance, not policy, with no runtime and no LLM.
//!
//! Workflows are **global-only**, exactly like fragments and profiles: a repo
//! layer may *declare* `[[workflows]]` but the loader strips them (see
//! [`crate::fragment::Layer::contributes_workflows`] and
//! `strip_global_only`), so a cloned repo can never inject a workflow.
//!
//! This module is the data model: the types, validation, the artifact-path
//! convention, a content hash, the shipped [`builtin_workflows`] catalog, and
//! [`resolve_workflow`]. Rendering — the context section and the per-stage slash
//! commands — lives in a later slice and is intentionally absent here.
